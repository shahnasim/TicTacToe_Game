This project is an implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python and the Pygame library. Additionally, it features an AI opponent that plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm for adversarial search.

Project Structure
The project is organized into several files:

runner.py: This is the main file containing the implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game logic, including the GUI using Pygame.

tictactoe.py: This file contains the implementation of the Minimax algorithm used by the AI opponent to determine its moves.

README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, requirements, and instructions for running the game.

LICENSE: A file containing the license information for the project.

Requirements:
To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game with the AI opponent, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the Pygame library. You can install Pygame using pip:
pip install pygame

Running the Game:
To run the game, execute the 'runner.py' file.

Gameplay Instructions:
Player Turn: Click on an empty cell to place your move (X).
AI Turn: The AI opponent (O) will automatically make its move after you.
Game Outcome: The game will automatically detect if there's a winner or if it's a draw.
Restart: Click on the "play again" button to start a new game after finishing one.
